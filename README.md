# Graffiti Wall

Welcome to the Graffiti Wall! This is a chaotic and fun web project where anyone can leave their mark. Like a public wall in an alleyway, but on the internet.

You can visit the wall at **[wall.innominate.win](https://wall.innominate.win)**.

## The Concept

The idea is simple: one single HTML page that **anyone** can edit. Visitors can add text, change styles, embed images, or modify the layout. The page is a living document, constantly changing based on who visits and what they decide to create (or destroy!).

It's a little experiment to see what people will create or destroy when given full control. Will it be a beautiful masterpiece, a chaotic mess, or something in between? Guess you'll have to take a look and see!

## Features

- **Live Editing:** Change the HTML of the main page directly.
- **Public Access:** No login, no accounts. If you can access the page, you can edit it.
- **Persistent Changes:** Your edits are saved and will be seen by everyone who comes along after, until someone removes them!
- **Live Chat:** A basic chat feature to discuss changes, coordinate with others, or yell into the void.

## Purpose

This project was built as a fun experiment during a 24-hour hackathon and helped me learn a little about Webpack and Firebase! It also has some basic protections against XSS attacks, but it's mostly just for fun. Enjoy!
